An extendable library for in-layout notifications. Can show multiple notifications concurrently or consecutively.

More information will follow.

More information will follow.


Credits
=======
Loosely based on [Crouton][1] and [UndoBar][2].

This library incorporates code from Roman Nurik's [Swipe-to-Dismiss][3].

Additionally, this library uses Jake Wharton's [NineOldAndroids][4] to allow backwards compatibility up to API level 4 (not tested yet).
